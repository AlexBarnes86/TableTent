# TableTent
Table tents for role playing games

Quick and dirty css hacked together to get something working for a local gaming group.

# TODO
* Backside should probably have something, maybe useful stats for the player
needs to be rendered upside down for proper printing/folding
* Image selection, some basic character generation features
* Add interactive features like turning on/off fields, change field sizes, add remove rows
